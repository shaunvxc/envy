# envy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shaunvxc/envy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaunvxc/envy) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/envy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/envy)

### Why?

Ever needed to look at some code living in one of your virtual environments? And then spent a good 3 or 4 seconds typing out the path? At which point you were weary about making changes/setting breakpoints in your site-packages without first creating a backup... which then needed to be restored again after testing, and yada yada yada.  *This workflow is annoying and tedious*.

`envy` is a utility that allows you to ****safely**** **interact with all of the site-packages** in your currently active `virtualenv` as if they were in your **current working directory.**

![envy_best5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3979753/13486757/df564a3a-e0e1-11e5-9e48-666fb658f6f4.gif)

### How?
Let's say you are working in a virtual environment for a project `foo` but are getting errors thrown from one of `foo`'s depedencies-- a library called `bar`.  The stacktrace tells us the error was thrown from `baz.py`.  Using `envy`, simply run (from anywhere in your file system):

`(foo)$ envy edit bar/baz.py`

and you'll instantly be looking at the point-of-error from your favorite text editor!

##### Great, the file is open, but I shouldn't create a backup before editing a file in my site-packages? :confused:
This is a good practice, but with `envy`, there is no need!  Before launching the editor, `envy` first creates a backup of the package in `~/.envies/foo/bar`.   

Environment safe from corruption, you can confidentally throw down some `pdb` breakpoints, `print` statements, or any little hack you want!   Whenever you are ready to **restore the package back to it's original state**, you need only run:

`(foo)$ envy clean bar`

And it'll be like you were never there!

### Wait, there's more! :pig2: :egg:

Say you maintain a library `ham`, as well as another project `eggs` that depends on `ham`.  You want to test out some of your recent changes to `ham`, but are far from ready to start messing with the versioning or running `setup.py install`. With `envy` you can very quickly sync the changes from your local dev copy of `ham` to the one that lives `eggs` virtual environment like so:

`(eggs)$ envy sync ham`

You can also sync indivual files:

`(eggs)$ envy sync ham/spam.py`

***Note:*** `envy sync` commands must be run from within your local copy of the package you are syncing (i.e. `ham`)

As with `envy edit`, an backup of the package's (`ham`'s) state will be created automatically.  As with before, to restore the original state:

`(eggs)$ envy clean ham`

## No talk, straight usage :no_mouth:

####Edit any file from any site-package installed in your active virtual environment:

`(active-virtualenv)$ envy edit any-site-package/any-file.py`

####Discard any and all edits and return `any-site-package` to its original state:

`(active-virtualenv)$ envy clean any-site-package`

You can run both `edit` and `clean` from anywhere in your filesystem, as long as you are in a virtualenv that contains the package you ask it for.

####Restore all edited packages to their original state:

`(active-virtualenv)$ envy clean --all`

####Sync all local changes from `random_lib` to where it lives in `some-virtualenv`:

`(some-virtualenv):dev/random_lib$ envy sync random_lib`

For the time being, `sync` commands cannot be run as flexibly as `edit` and `clean` (they will only work when run from within the python package you wish to sync)- although it would certainly be possible to improve this in the future.

####View the differences between the current copy of a package and its backed up (clean) copy:

`(some-virtualenv):$ envy diff package`

####To drop a backup for a specific package, say, `bar`, run:

```bash
(foo)$ envy reset bar
dropping saved envie for bar
```

####To remove all backups for a given environment, call it `foo`, run:

```bash
(foo)$ envy reset --all
dropping saved envie for bar
dropping saved envie for baz
dropping saved envie for requests
```

***Note:***
`envy edit` uses the `$EDITOR` environment varible to launch a text editor-- if this is not set, simply add:

`export EDITOR=your_editor_of_choice`

to your `.bashrc` file.

##Installation
`$ pip install envy`

For manual installation:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/shaunvxc/envy.git
$ cd envy
$ python setup.py install
```

##Future work:
- add a `envy diff` function to compare currently applied changes with the clean, backed-up copy
- Explore the option of packaging in a diff. format (installation with `curl`), in order for it to be available globally (rather than on a per `virtualenv` basis)
- handle egg-named locally built packages? or enforce local building with pip instead?
- allow `sync` to be run from anywhere on filesystem (would likely require an env-var like `$DEV_SRC`)
- improve test coverage
- add optional virtualenv argument to allow syncing/editing to nonactive virtualenvs
